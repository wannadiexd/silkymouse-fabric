# SilkyMouse

A Fabric port of [TapeMouse](https://github.com/dries007/TapeMouse) by @dries007.

Don't use this on a server that does not allow AFK farming.
It is detectable, and I'm not planning on making it undetectable.

## How to use

Use `/silkymouse <off|name of keybinding> [delay]`

To get a list of the keybindings: `/silkymouse list`

Sometimes, when you go to a menu or pause the game, it stops working.
To restart it, activate the keybinding manually once.

## Features

- Hold down or repeatedly press any Minecraft keybinding
- Configure the delay between keypresses
- Simple command-based interface
- Works with any Minecraft key binding

## Examples

- `/silkymouse attack 0` - Hold down left mouse button
- `/silkymouse jump 20` - Jump every second (20 ticks)
- `/silkymouse forward 0` - Hold down forward key
