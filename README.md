TapeMouse
=========

Tape + Mouse = TapeMouse

Don't use this on a server that does not allow AFK farming.
It is detectable, and I'm not planning on making it undetectable.

How to use
----------

Use `/tapemouse <off|name of keybinding> [delay]`

To get a list of the keybindings: `/tapemouse`

Sometimes, when you go to a menu or pause the game, it stops working.
To restart it, activate the keybinding manually once.
